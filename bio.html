								I am User Experience designer with <strong>4 years of industry experience</strong> in India. I am currently finishing my Master's degree in Human-Computer Interaction at Georgia Institute of Technology and am <strong>looking for a full-time role that starts in July</strong>. Outside of work, I am a yoga teacher, a seasoned backpacker, and an aspiring vegan chef.

							<h4>My unique skills</h4><br/>Even though I have handled the end-to-end UX design process in past roles, my strength is in distilling research insights and creating designs that balance user needs, business requirements, and technical constraints. I play the role of the user advocate on my teams by helping contextualize new feature ideas in user scenarios and task flows. I take extra steps to understand the problem before jumping into solving it. I can both rapidly sketch low-fidelity ideas to brainstorm solutions and convert a design vision to a realistic high-fidelity clickable prototype. Having worked with several engineers and written code myself, I am comfortable partnering with engineers and working within technical constraints. I can quickly learn new skills on the job and apply them to projects. I take the initiative to go beyond the brief and am constantly trying to find opportunities to make the product and the process better.

								<h4>My design journey</h4><br/>I started my career in India as a part-time graphic designer alongside my full-time undergrad degree in Civil Engineering. Then I worked for a year as a UI designer at a design consultancy where I learned about UX. I wanted to be closer to the product and work in collaboration with business and engineering, so I shifted to tech startups. After 2 years of working there as a UX Designer, I moved to the US to study Human-Computer Interaction at Georgia Institute of Technology to get formal education in design.</p>
								<p> At Georgia Tech, I added new methods to my toolkit. I learned how to do affinity mapping, storyboarding, quantitative usability testing, and design ideation. I also gained soft skills in articulation, bridging team communication, critical thinking, and rigorous detail orientation. </p>
							
							</p>

								<h4>What I am looking for</h4><br/>Until now, I have only worked on small-scale early-stage products with less than 100 users. In most instances, I have been the first designer in the organization and have been responsible for setting up the design process. Because of the rapidly changing priorities in the teams and simultaneous development of multiple products, I have not been able to stay with one product for more than one release cycle.</p>
								<p>
								In the future, I am looking for a role where I get to work on a large-scale information system within a mature product team. I want to work on a product that has multiple user roles, a large number of use cases, and several interconnected workflows. I want to stay with the product as it evolves across multiple release cycles. I am looking for a collaborative team that has a culture of constructive feedback, building on ideas, learning from others, and continued growth. 
								</p>
								<p>My long-term vision is to grow into a design leader, and I can best gain those skills by being in a system where good practices are successfully in place. I want work in an organization which has established design processes and senior design leadership who I can learn from. </p>

							  <h4>Outside of work</h4><br/>My passion for design bleeds outside my day job. In 2014, I led the organization of India's first design-themed Startup Weekend, a 3-day startup hack-a-thon that had close to 60 attendees. Our event template and toolkits were also distributed to and appreciated by the global Startup Weekend community. In the same year, I also volunteered to mentor startups in India's Microsoft Accelerator program.</a> 
							</p>
							<p>
							  Other than being a designer, I am also a practicing yoga teacher. I have been teaching Hatha yoga since 2015. I have backpacked in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1Zc9BVtB_nsCrPHhw7fQnKJRvGuI&ll=17.731525033864425%2C-2.0344949500000666&z=3" target="_blank">more than 10 countries</a> around the world and volunteered to teach kids at a <a href="http://www.shantibhavanchildren.org/" target="_blank">village school</a> in India. These days, I am experimenting with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/greenchilliesandkale/" target="_blank"> new vegan recipes</a>.
