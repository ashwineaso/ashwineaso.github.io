							<p class="summary-head">About the company </p><p class="summary-block-content">HackerEarth is a start-up that makes products that help tech companies hire software developers. From its inception in 2012 to present day, they have helped 500+ companies, including Amazon, Intuit, Boeing, Maersk and so on, hire software developers for multiple roles.  </p>

							<p class="summary-head">About the <br/>product</p><p class="summary-block-content">HackerEarth Recruit, this SaaS application, is one of their main products and is meant for first-level filtering of candidates, i.e., selecting candidates to interview from the entire pool of applicants. On this application, recruiters can create coding tests and invite candidates to take the test. The application&apos;s algorithm automatically checks candidates&apos; responses and scores them based on specific parameters set by the recruiter. The application provides detailed reports on the candidates&apos; performance, from which the recruiter can then filter the best. </p>
						</div>
						<div class="summary-block">
							<p class="summary-head">My role </p><p class="summary-block-content">I joined the company in 2013, when it was an early-stage startup, as their first full-time designer. This product was then in the beta phase and had about 25 enterprise customers. </p>
						</div>
						<div class="summary-block">
							<p class="summary-head">Problem, <br/>Solution, <br/>Impact</p><p class="summary-block-content"> In the beta, the development team was hand-holding the users in the process of creating tests, inviting candidates, and viewing reports. I designed the first public version of this product surfacing the features that the development team was handling on the back-end, thus enabling the users to independently operate the application. It helped the developers focus their energy on building new features and evolving the product to gain more customers rather than on doing tech support for existing customers. After implementation of the changes, this application was marketed heavily and gained 25+ enterprise customers in the next 8 months. </p>

						<h3>
							Interviewed company founders and existing users to understand the developer recruitment process 
						</h3>
						<p>When I joined this project, I was completely unfamiliar with this domain. Since HackerEarth was an early-stage start-up, they did not have any documentation on what they had learned about the industry so far. So, I interviewed the founders to understand how the industry works, who the users are, and what problems the product solves. Additionally, I talked to 7 recruiters from our existing customer-base to understand their recruitment process and pain points.</p>

						<h3>
							Understood the rationale for new features and contextualized them using tasks, scenarios, and user roles
						</h3>
						<p>When I had joined this project, the start-up founders had given me a list of features they wanted me to include in the new design. I talked to them to understand the rationale for the new features they were proposing. I contextualized these features in the user&apos;s lives by mapping the tasks they corresponded to, the scenarios they would be useful in, and the user roles that would use them. </p>

						<h3>
							Sketched task flows to understand where new features would fit in the interface and created mockups
						</h3>
						<p>
							For each new feature, I sketched user flows based on the tasks and scenarios. They helped me understand where these features would fit in the existing interface. Based on this understanding, I created mockups for the new design.</p>

						<h3>
							Updated the visual style and assisted in front-end development with visual specs
						</h3>
						<p>The startup founders wanted to launch the public product with an updated visual design that looked professional and modern. So, I created the new UI style, based on which I designed the mockups shown above. Throughout the implementation process, I assisted the developers by providing them with visual specs and redlines.   I also suggested CSS corrections in the implemented design to make sure it was built to perfection</p>

						<h3>
							Feedback after launch
						</h3>
						<p>After the public launch, this product was marketed heavily and, as a result, gained 25+ enterprise customers in next 8 months. We got positive feedback from recruiters who conducted tests using this application, along with requests for new features. </p>
						<p>I looked at customer support requests and talked to the person responsible for onboarding new customers. I found that the users were able to use the product easily once they had learned how to use it. But onboarding was a challenge because this way of conducting recruitment was new to many companies. I realized that we had not paid attention to the onboarding flow of the application. So I suggested designing UI indicators for onboarding new users. However, that could not be implemented because of other priorities. </p>

						<!-- <p> After the product was actively being used, I had asked if I could visit a company which   </p> -->

						<!-- <p>north-star metric - number of students tested, other metrics, number of tests condcuted, candidates tested vs hired for a test, or funneled to the next stage, utility of the product, number of customer support tickets per flow, number of enterprise customers, number of tests per company, number of candidates per company, I also asked them let me go and observe but that was out of budget, they wanted me to work on other things</p> -->
						<!-- <p>Feedback - user onboarding was a problems, we were so focused on the features that we didn’t think about how this application should weave into the recruitment process, I suggested implementing an onboarding tool, but that was too much effot, so we added a presention for the first page when a new user logs in , crude solution</p> -->
						<!-- <p>Before release it much more mangeed process, after release, it was just a mayhem. At the end, the features were just jammed in without too much thought</p> -->

						<h3>
							My role beyond UX design
						</h3>
						<p>Since this was a startup, we never had enough hands to do all the work. I felt invested in the product&apos;s success, so it was launched and was being marketed, I helped with writing client communication, creating emailers, designing advertising graphics (both print and digital), designing marketing pages, writing customer support emails, and making marketing presentations.</p>

					<!-- <div class="text-width" ><h2><span class="head-style">Reflection</span></h2></div>
					<div class="text-width">
						<h3>
							What went well
						</h3>
						<p>The most exciting and rewarding parts of this project for me were the chance to take ownership of my work, work side-by-side with developers, learn about how design affects business and engineering, learn about the developers&apos; process, and see my designs become real.</p>
						<div class="text-width"><hr/></div> -->
						<!-- <h3>
							What I could have done better
						</h3>
						<p>Since I was the only designer on the team, there was no one to question my design ideas. Because of the break-neck speed at which the product was being built, there were times when my first ideas were developed where O should have spent time exploring a little bit more. If I were to re-do this project, I would plan the design process differently. I would prioritize the list of features at the beginning of the project and set timelines for each small design piece so it would get the time and attention it needed.   </p> -->
						<!-- <p>Did not think about first time use</p>
						<p>During the design and development phase, I had suggested doing usability testing with users who had not seen the product to understand the experience of a new customer.</p>
						<p> <h4>Measuring usage</h4><br/>Right after launch, I had suggested implementing MixPanel to measure usage metrics and had created a list of data points I wanted to collect to validate (or invalidate) assumptions I had made in the design. </p> -->
						
						<!-- <p>Frustrating, mismanaged process and too large scope, me being pulled in two different directions of system level (product vision) and pixel level thinking being the only designers, lack of designer to help me think of this differently, first ideas were developed, first time building a design system from scratch and have no one else to get feedback, too scrappy for me, </p> -->

						<!-- <p>What I could have done better is to spend a little more time exploring ideas, in the rush of developing, the first ideas were pushed out many times as I have learnt now that the first ideas are not the best ones (link)</p><p>suggestng hiring another design, too large scope for me alone, but that wasn&apos;t possible</p> -->
						
						<!-- <p>Could not spend time explornig all features</p> -->
						<!-- <p>I thought about one flow, but did not think about the states of the different pages. For example, for the test detail page - description, question settings, publish test in between</p> -->
