			<div class="text-width">
				<p>
					We conducted market research in the top 5 cities in India around key factors such as the age group applying for the loan, 
					their employment, annual income, educational qualification, financial knowledge and financial history.
					<br><br>
					Our primary research was done were done both online — via survey and polls, and offline — user interviews and paper surveys, 
					cross multiple industries, backgrounds and standards of living.
					<br><br>
					For our secondary research, we used financial data and yearly reports published by top consulting companies, 
					along with those published by the Reserve Bank of India — India’s central banking institution.

			<div class="text-width"><h2><span class="head-style">Observations and Primary Conclusions</span></h2></div>
			<div class="text-width">
				<p>
					The user interviews and market research led us to the following conclusion
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						A majority of the people were between the age group of 25 to 32, with a median annual salary of USD 4200, 
						employed at low or mid-level positions at private companies.
					</li>
					<li>
						The top reasons for applying for a loan included
						<ul>
							<li>Purchasing a 2 wheeler — scooter/motorcycle</li>
							<li>Medical Emergencies</li>
							<li>Purchasing electronic equipment</li>
							<li>Refinancing credit card debt</li>
							<li>Educational fees</li>
							<li>Home Renovation/Furniture</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Most of the people were using Android devices with 3G/4G internet connection. 
						Their interaction with their banks happened via mobile banking applications
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					Based on the research we narrowed our focus down to salaried individuals employed at private companies, 
					with an acceptable credit score of > 660 (out of 900), and having a decent banking history. 
					This aligned with the risk appetite of the company and streamlined the process to maximize 
					automation and no paper-based process involved.

			<div class="text-width">
				<p>
					Considering the business requirements and the pain points that the users faced in competitor apps, 
					we designed the process flow in three stages. The stages were designed in short bursts to reduce the drop-off, 
					while also informing the users about important state changes in their application.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h3>The initial “instant” loan application</h3>
				<p>
					The instant loan form was the first filter at the top of the funnel. We tailored it with appropriate checks for pin code, 
					employment and annual income to inform the user at an early stage that their application could not be considered to 
					due to lack of service in their locality, or because of company policies
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					The loan application is halted if the pin code provided is of an unserviceable area. 
					The user can choose to provide us with their contact information so that we can inform them when their locality becomes serviceable.
					<br><br>
					The application proceeds only if the user is working in a privately owned company, and has a monthly income of at least 15,000 INR. 
					Reasons such as “Medical Emergency” is given a higher priority and given special consideration during the underwriting process.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					At the end of the flow, the loan application was marked as an “Instant loan — partially submitted” application. 
					The user was then urged to complete the next steps required for the underwriting approval
				</p>
				<br>
				<h3>The extended loan completion flow</h3>
				<p>
					From the instant loan application, the user moves to the “Next Steps” stage, which consists of 4 steps. 
					When all 4 steps are completed, the application is reviewed by the underwriting team. 
					If approved, an appointment would be booked for the nearest available slot, 
					for residence verification and for completing the final steps.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					The report is evaluated for various factors which give us ideas about the user’s fixed obligations and their credit history. 
					We analyze the risk involved and decide whether a loan will be accepted/ rejected at this step.
					<br><br>
					The bank statements are analyzed to understand the user’s spending pattern, other EMIs and verify that they are a 
					salaried employee of a company. Reckless spending patterns and red flagged activities may cause the application 
					to be rejected at this step.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h3>The post — disbursal flow</h3>
				<p>
					The post disbursal flow includes informing and alerting the users about the repayment plan. 
					The flow would also inform them about repayment amount, foreclosure charges, 
					late fees and provide them with an online payment option.
				</p>

					Based on our observation of users’ pain points in competitor applications, and through a series of A/B testing, 
					we defined a few design guidelines that provided the most seamless transition through the different stages.

				<h3>The Good, The Bad and The Buggy</h3>
				<p>
					Users were provided with two options for uploading bank statements. One was to login into their net banking accounts 
					via a third-party interface, which posed the concern of security among the users. One was to login into their net 
					banking accounts via a third-party interface, which posed the concern of security among the users.
				</p>

				<h3>Less is More v/s More is Better</h3>
				<p>
					While the designs were aligned to ask for the least amount of information as possible, we had to introduce dynamic 
					elements along certain pathways to collect more data points for the system to process the loan. This posed a different 
					challenge, as we needed to explain to the users about the need for it to avoid and reduce potential drop-offs.
				</p>

				<h3>Asking for forgiveness now, not later!</h3>
				<p>
					We fined tuned all our notifications, success and error messages to be elaborate enough for the user to 
					understand what happened behind the system.
