				<h3>About the Company</h3>
				<p>
					As a Non-Banking Financial Company that lends small ticket personal loans, we tend to have tens of thousands of 
					applications every month. A key part of the loan application process is the Credit Report Analysis, which is a 
					key decision-maker in the applicants’ loan being accepted or rejected. Over 2 years we gathered our observations 
					about what would constitute as a poor credit history and looked for opportunities to educate people about improving it. 
				</p>
			</div>			
			<div class="text-width">
				<h3>Defining the Problem Space</h3>
				<p>
					Analyzing over a million reports, we understood that there is a lack of basic financial education among the people, 
					which seemed a good space to start our exploration. We aimed to provide them with basic to advanced insights into 
					their credit history, and the actions they can take to improve it for a better credit rating. 
				</p>

				<h3>Conducting primary research</h3>
				<p>
					We started our user research by conducting an online survey among our existing user base, whose loan application 
					had to be rejected due to poor credit history. This included around 10,000 users spread over five cities in India, 
					from different backgrounds. 
				</p>
				<!-- <div class="post-image text-width">

				</div> -->
				<h3>Conclusions of primary and secondary research</h3>
				<p>
					Around 70% of the interviewed were willing to subscribe to a paid plan for quarterly reports. 45% of the people 
					wanted personalized suggestions on how to keep a healthy score. 65% wanted to get a deeper insight into their 
					report and understand the factors 
					<br>
					<br>
					From our market research studies, we were able to understand, that a huge proportion of our user base, 
					were willing to subscribe towards a service which offered them quarterly reports about their Credit History. 
					Almost half of them highlighted that they wanted the tips and suggestions to be personalized to their report.

				<h3>Summary - Overview of Report</h3>
				<p>
					The Summary page gives the user a quick overview of the different factors in their report. 
					Considering the lack of real estate on a mobile view, we restricted the content to a few key aspects - 
					the current score and its change from the previous report if available; active loan accounts and credit cards; 
					and highlights of the top factors reducing your Credit Score

			<div class="text-width"><h2><span class="head-style">Design Challenges and Constraints</span></h2></div>
			<div class="text-width">
				<h3>Designing for multiple states.</h3>
				<p>
					One of the major constraints was to design for different states if the dashboard. Based on how much, 
					or how elaborate the data of the user was, we had to design for 3 different states.
				</p>

				<h4>1. Credit Age is lesser than 6 months</h4>
				<p>
					The User was New To Credit, and had no credit history or their history is recent enough to not be 
					assigned a score - the dashboard of this user would barely have enough information for metrics and 
					would have to rely on generic tips and suggestions on how to achieve a good score.
				</p>
				<h4>2. Credit Age is between 6 months to a Year</h4>
				<p>
					User has a credit history of more than 6 months, but less than a year - For such users, 
					we designed a minimal dashboard with details on current loans and credit cards, with useful 
					tips on payments to maintain a good score, or improve from a poor one.
				</p>
				<h4>3. Credit Age is more than a Year</h4>
				<p>
					TUser has a credit history of more than a year - this user would have the full-feature version of the dashboard. 
					Most of our users belonged to this category.
				</p>

				<h3>Feedback on the Content and Suggestions</h3>
				<p>
					The success of the product depended entirely on how useful the user found the content to be. 
					To validate the effectiveness of this, we placed feedback forms, and buttons to upvote/ downvote the 
					suggestions that we provided them.
