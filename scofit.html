				<h3>About the Company</h3>
				<p>
					As a Non-Banking Financial Company that lends small ticket personal loans, we tend to have tens of thousands of 
					applications every month. A key part of the loan application process is the Credit Report Analysis, which is a 
					key decision-maker in the applicants’ loan being accepted or rejected. Over 2 years we gathered our observations 
					about what would constitute as a poor credit history and looked for opportunities to educate people about improving it. 
				</p>
			</div>			
			<div class="text-width">
				<h3>Defining the Problem Space</h3>
				<p>
					Analyzing over a million reports, we understood that there is a lack of basic financial education among the people, 
					which seemed a good space to start our exploration. We aimed to provide them with basic to advanced insights into 
					their credit history, and the actions they can take to improve it for a better credit rating. 
				</p>

			<!-- Start User Research -->
			<div class="text-width"><h2><span class="head-style">User Research</span></h2></div>
			<div class="text-width">
				<h3>Conducting primary research</h3>
				<p>
					We started our user research by conducting an online survey among our existing user base, whose loan application 
					had to be rejected due to poor credit history. This included around 10,000 users spread over five cities in India, 
					from different backgrounds. 
				</p>
				<div class="post-image text-width">
					<img src="images/scofit_user_research.png">
				</div>
				<h3>Conclusions of primary and secondary research</h3>
				<p>
					Around 70% of the interviewed were willing to subscribe to a paid plan for quarterly reports. 45% of the people 
					wanted personalized suggestions on how to keep a healthy score. 65% wanted to get a deeper insight into their 
					report and understand the factors 
					<br>
					<br>
					From our market research studies, we were able to understand, that a huge proportion of our user base, 
					were willing to subscribe towards a service which offered them quarterly reports about their Credit History. 
					Almost half of them highlighted that they wanted the tips and suggestions to be personalized to their report.

				<p>
					One of the major constraints was to design for different states if the dashboard. Based on how much, 
					or how elaborate the data of the user was, we had to design for 3 different states.
