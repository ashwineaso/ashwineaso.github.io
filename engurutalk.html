					<p class="summary-block-content">
            The purpose of the project was to design a session booking flow for an online live learning platform. 
            The project took us through the process of defining the user journey, the sitemap, 
            the different states of the layouts, and finally design a prototype of the platform. 
            This project focuses only on the booking of the session, and the path associated with it.

            I led the initial team of engineers to plan, design and develop the project from scratch, launching the initial 
            version of the product on June 2016. I worked with the design team, taking up the responsibility of building 
            the process flow while aligning it with the business decisions of the company.

				<h3>About the Company</h3>
				<p>
          enguru (enguruapp.com) is the fastest-growing spoken English learning app in India. 
          Starting as offline classes, enguru then launched standalone applications for web, android and iOS. 
          The apps provided a gamified approach to communicative English learning for workplace environments. 
          enguruTalk is an add-on premium product, launched on a web platform. It provided live video classes 
          as hourly group sessions to subscribed users.

				<h3>The Problem Statement</h3>
				<p>
          enguruTalk aims to bring the interactive experience of a classroom to an online platform. 
          The problem statement - “To create a path of least effort for a new user to book a live group class”. 
          These included the process of onboarding, enrolling, payment and booking.

			<div class="text-width">
				<p>
          On reaching out to a user base of ~5M users (as of Jun 2016), we understood a growing need among users, 
          to compliment the enguru app with interactive classes. These consisted of an individual in the following scenarios
          <ul>
            <li>Users didn’t have the option on affordable English training in their locality.</li>
            <li>Users’ had a full-time jobs and could not find the time to attend the classes.</li>
          </ul>
          The insights from the research, helped us define the statement - users wanted to attend interactive classes, 
          from the comfort of their office or home, with flexible timings.

			<div class="text-width">
        <p>
          The process we considered started from the point the user had on-boarded and is browsing through the available courses. 
          The first conversion from a user to a customer happens when the user completes the booking of a session.

			<div class="text-width">

				<h3>Browsing the available courses.</h3>
				<p>
          We started with two courses Business English and General English. Both of them had three levels - Beginner, 
          Intermediate and Advanced. The user could review lessons and topics in each level choose their learning level based on it.
				</p>
				<div class="post-image text-width">
					<img src="images/scofit_user_research.png">
        </div>

        <h3>Viewing the details of a Course</h3>
				<p>
          Users can book classes to up to one week in advance. They can choose a preferred slot from a list of available slots. 
          We designed the courses in the way that one lesson is taught per day, in every session.
				</p>
				<div class="post-image text-width">
					<img src="images/scofit_user_research.png">
        </div>

        <h3>Choosing the session</h3>
				<p>
          User can choose the date of the session in the next 7 days. The time slots of the available session will be displayed. 
          Filled session slots will not be selectable. User can choose an unfilled one and confirm to proceed.
				</p>
				<div class="post-image text-width">
					<img src="images/scofit_user_research.png">
        </div>
        
        <h3>Reviewing the details</h3>
				<p>
          Upon selection of the slot, the user can review the details of the session - such as the course, lesson, 
          timing and cost, before moving on to payment.
				</p>
				<div class="post-image text-width">
					<img src="images/scofit_user_research.png">
        </div>
        
        <h3>Confirming and Paying</h3>
				<p>
          One a user books a slot, they can confirm it and make a payment. They can also choose to redeem a coupon code here. 
          Clicking the “Confirm and Pay” button then takes the user to the payment gateway where they can complete the payment.

        <h3>Multilingual support</h3>
        <p>
          None of our users was native English speakers, and a large majority had not received formal education with 
          English as their primary language. To address this issue, we had to design the entire application to support 
          multiple languages.
        </p>
				<div class="post-image text-width">
					<img src="images/scofit_user_research.png">
        </div>
        <p>
          Since our target demographic also included a lot of native Arabic speakers, we had to design the app to 
          support RTL languages too. This proved to be a harder challenge, as we had to adapt the alignments, 
          positioning, flow and interactions of several elements to suit this need.
        </p>
        			
        <h3>Simple instructions in steps</h3>
        <p>
          The instructions to complete the booking we made to be clear and concise. This ensured that the user 
          would not have to guess at any point in the flow, as to what the next step would have to be.
